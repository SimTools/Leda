2003/12/25    KalTest Package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0) Organization of the KalTest package
doc:         documments
geomlib:     geometry liabrary containing classes to describe track models and
             measurement layers
kallib:      general purpose abstract base classes to implement Kalman filter 
             algorithm (TVKalSystem, TVKalSite, TVKalState)
kaltest:     sample programs to illustrate usage of the libraries
kaltracklib: derived classes that implement pure virtuals of kallib for track
             fitting purpose and abstract base classes to describe
              a) individual measurement layers (TVMeasLayer)
              b) detector system as a collection of measurement layers carrying
                 information on the material budget (TVKalDetector)
              c) hit point on each measurement layer (TVTrackHit)
Makefile:    makefile to build the libraries
README:      this file

- See documments in the doc subdirectory for more information

1) How to Build the Kalman Filter Libraries
- Install ROOT if you haven't.
- Set ROOTSYS environmental variable accordingly.
- Got to LEDA's top directory
  $ export LEDAROOT=`pwd`
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LEDAROOT/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $ make

2) How to Run Test Programs
- Cd to the kaltest subdirectory.
- Choose one of the subsubdirectories in it:
    cdc: track fitting example for a jet-chamber-like central tracker
    tpc: track fitting example for a TPC-like central tracker
    simple: a simple line fit example using the base kallib libraries only
- Cd into the subsubdirectory you chose, build the test program, and run
  as follows:
  $ xmkmf -a
  $ make
  $ cd prod
  $ ./EXKalTest

Note:
  KalTest package has been built and tested on
	MacOSX 10.2
	RedHat 9.0
  with ROOT3.10.00 and the gcc3 compiler.
